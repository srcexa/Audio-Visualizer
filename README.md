# Audio-Visualizers
## BARS.
This project is an audio visualizer that uses p5.js library to analyze and visualize the frequency spectrum of an audio file in real-time. 
It creates a visual representation of the audio data by drawing a series of bars on the canvas. The height and color of each bar is determined by 
the amplitude of the corresponding frequency in the audio spectrum.

#### Features
<li>Real-time audio visualization</li>
<li>Play/pause functionality</li>
<li>Customizable bar width and gap between bars</li>
<li>Rotating animation of bars</li>

## BEACH.
This project is a terrain visualization that uses the p5.js library to create a 3D representation of a terrain generated using perlin noise. The terrain is animated using a frequency spectrum analysis of an audio file, resulting in a dynamic visualization that changes with the music.

#### Features 
<li>Real-time terrain visualization</li>
<li>Audio frequency spectrum analysis</li>
<li>Animate terrain based on music</li>
<li>Customizable terrain size and resolution</li>
<li>Dynamic color scheme</li>
