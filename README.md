# Audio-Visualizer
## BARS.
This project is an audio visualizer that uses p5.js library to analyze and visualize the frequency spectrum of an audio file in real-time. 
It creates a visual representation of the audio data by drawing a series of bars on the canvas. The height and color of each bar is determined by 
the amplitude of the corresponding frequency in the audio spectrum.
